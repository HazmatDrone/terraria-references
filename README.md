### Steampunk
[steampunk-grandhouse.jpg](steampunk-grandhouse.jpg)
- Wonderful curved roofing
- Use of pearlwood and stone creates really interesting wals
- Really nice spiral staircase

[steampunk-largeclutteredhouse.jpg](steampunk-largeclutteredhouse.jpg)
- Really interesting overall shape, and wood texture
- The little attic workshop is *adorable*
- Overhanging rooms could be nice
- Having a little outdoor area underneath a room with pillars looks really neat

[steampunk-pointyhouse.jpg](steampunk-pointyhouse.jpg)
- The pointed roof on this design is really impressive, especially how they manage to blend it with the wood
- The extra work done on the chimney looks fantastic
- The pole of buffs is really clever

[steampunk-simplehouse.jpg](steampunk-simplehouse.jpg)
- A perfect example of making the most of a very small space
- Triangular roof is broken up with a bit of a sharp edge on the left and right and the plateau on top

[steampunk-tinyhouse.png](steampunk-tinyhouse.png)
- Similar to above; makes nice use of small space
- Small docks on buildings are really cute but not that travel/mount friendly
- Adding variation in shape to roofing instead of a standard trapezoidal roof really pays off

### Rustic
[slimehouse.jpg](slimehouse.jpg)
- Nice thatch roof
- Interesting stair and floor design
- Feels aesthetically consistent
- The ground floor is a really neat design for something mounts could run through relatively easily (even though they don't use it that way in this image)

[windmill-farmhouse.jpg](windmill-farmhouse.jpg)
- The vines are really nice as rustic decor
- The roofing, wooden and stone floors, crossbeams, and subflooring leads to a rustic style I've never quite seen so well done before
- Actuated cog blocks and tin plating make for some cool mechanical parts to the windmill interior
- Really nice chimney

### Modern
[modern-house.jpg](modern-house.jpg)
- This house has used wallpapers and materials really well to create an early 20th century feel
- The small basement works really nicely for this house but the storage implications are a bit impractical (but this house wasn't going for that)
- Armor stands in the windows along with a fitting room is a neat way to portray a tailor shop
- The attic bedroom is adorable, especially with the little window
- The side of the house never feels flat

[spiky-fancy-house.png](spiky-fancy-house.png)
- Wonderful spiky roof

### Oriental
[blue-oriental-house.png](blue-oriental-house.png)
- Really nice blending of wood and some really good use of wallpaper and paint (and lighting?) to make a warm white paper style
- Exceptional shape

[terraria-city-castle.png](terraria-city-castle.png)
- Too many amazing things to write up atm lol

### Cyberpunk
[cyberpunk-hotel.png](cyberpunk-hotel.png)
- Styling on the HOTEL sign is cleverly reminiscent of neon tube signs that require one continuous tube to work
- The staircases are actually amazing, wow
- COFFEE
- Glass kiln + tubing = awesome
- Ladder made of dynasty workbenches
- Painted runic wallpaper separated from the wall makes for really neat posters

[cyberpunk-hotel-2.png](cyberpunk-hotel-2.png)
- Really cool gun store sign design
- Nice satellite design
- Roofing detail is nice

[cyberpunk-hotel-3.png](cyberpunk-hotel-3.png)
- Really slick signage
- The bar is a clever little idea (I'd try using ale on a plate along with wine glasses and see if that looks even better)
- That's a hecking cool little spaceship

[cyberpunk-hotel-4.png](cyberpunk-hotel-4.png)
- 

### Storage
[storage-solution-tower.jpg](storage-solution-tower.jpg)
- Storage feels relatively hidden away and part of the building
- Almost the whole system can be accessed with one linear run through the building, but turns are necessary, which kill the player's velocity
- Suspending things from the roof via rope is a nice concept
- Fences behind diagonal crossbeam supports is a nice touch

### Greenhouse
[greenhouse_wooden_base.jpg](greenhouse_wooden_base.jpg)
- The wooden and stone base and supports 
- The staggered glass pattern makes for nice looking glass panels
- WOW the cave.

[greenhouse-large-tree.jpg](greenhouse-large-tree.jpg)
- Really cool tiling effect with the glass - is that vanilla?
- A nice circular edge makes it feel really greenhouse-y

[greenhouse-ornate.png](greenhouse-ornate.png)
- The overgrown botanical look to this building is amazing (although the tree would just get in the way)
- The use of statues and fountains and plants in grey planters is really nice
- The wooden walls along with the stained glass give a really nice overall feel
- Use gem glass instead of regular glass, hmm

[greenhouse-grassy.webp](greenhouse-grassy.webp)
- Amazing living wood brige, worth considering
- The way it appears to be built into the terrain (even if in reality it's artificial) is really neat
- The potion room is a really nice touch
- Most compact spiral staircase ever

### Jungle
[jungle-grandhouse.jpg](jungle-grandhouse.jpg)
- The bridge looks really cool and appears fully functional
- The rope ladders are a really nice touch
- The mix of wood types and the leaf roof make the building feel really natural
- The random mix of horizontal and vertical wood for the interior is really stylish
- The wood type used for the supports and crossbeams on the left structure make it look roped together, combined with the foliage snaking around it, looks really really cool

[jungle-nicehouses.png](jungle-nicehouses.png)
- Building over the water looks really pretty (although may cause problems with enemies)
- The main building has a nice double-sloped roof that any build could benefit from
- It could use more design on the supporting beams below the building to make it look more sturdy and less like it's floating

[jungle-tallhouses.jpg](jungle-tallhouses.jpg)
- The bridge between these two buildings looks very solid whilst still looking nice and primitive
- The spikes jutting out of the left building look interesting and could be used in a variety of builds
- The illusion of quadrilateral supports given by the foliage looks really interesting 

[jungle-tinyhouses.png](jungle-tinyhouses.png)
- Grass roofs? There's a cool idea to experiment with!
- Using trees as supports could look neat but it would need to blend a lot better for my tastes
- Vines dangling from under the building is also a clever idea
